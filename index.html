    <h1>Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h1>
    <pre>
        Both are comparison operators and they return boolean values always. The difference
        between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas “ === “ is
        used to compare both value and datatype.

    <h1>What is the spread operator?</h1>
    <pre>
        The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like
        arrays and objects to access the elements individually
    </pre>
    <h1>What are the differences between var, let and const?</h1>
    <pre>
        var is a global scoped means variables created using var keyword will be accessible globally. It
        can be redeclared and reinitialized.
        
        let is a block scoped means variables created using let keyword will be accessible only in that
        specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.
        
        const is also block scoped means variables created using const keyword will be accessible only
        in that specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared and cannot be
        reinitialized.
    </pre>
    <h1>What is execution context</h1>
    <pre>
        Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
        Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.
        JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of
        the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
        The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in
        its execution.

    <h1>What is meant by first class functions</h1>
    <pre>
        A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
        are treated like any other variable.
    </pre>
    <h1>What are closures? Give an example of closure</h1>
    <pre>
        A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
        surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an
        outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
        function is created, at function creation time.
    </pre>
    <h1>Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h1>
    <pre>
        call(): The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest
        of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.

        apply(): The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and
        rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.

        bind: The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference
        of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can
        use it by passing rest of the arguments.
